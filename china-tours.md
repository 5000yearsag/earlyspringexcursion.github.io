#### [Dali, Dali, Come to see our new home](/china-tours/dali-and-its-surroundings/)

Though Dali seems at a first glance, quite tourstic (still less than Lijiang), we will show what Dali truly is beyond tourism!

#### [QianDongNan, Back to thousand years ago](/china-tours/guizhou-qiandongnan/)

Discover the Dong and Miao minorities beyond the beaten path, a good advice, try to come before 2020!

#### [LuGu Lake to YaDin, Pilgrimage way towards the REAL Shambala](/china-tours/lugu-lake-yading/)

Yadin, a mountain sanctuary and major Tibetan pilgrimage site comprising three peaks sanctified by the 5th Dalai Lama.

**China**, such a huge country, ancient and modern culture mixed together, so vast and wondrous! We spent years to find those undiscovered places, and still many places never came into our ears.

Our travels through China showed us it is not an easy task neither to live nor travel especially for foreigners. That why we want to share our experience to facilitate your time in China and make it unforgettable! You can read our post [Why having a guide in China?](http://earlyspringexcursion.com/2017/10/11/tour-guide-china-useful/)

**Our guarantee**

  * minimalisation of tourist areas
  * Unique and authentic experiences
  * young and dynamic energy
  * the latest updated itineraries

We only organize self-tailored travels, so you can also share with us your ideal trip dream and we will do our best to make it come true!

Our activities aim to maximally benefit everyone involved; both the traveler, the locals and the environment. We are both conducting informal research in China&#8217;s remote ethnic villages and actively explore South China&#8217;s hidden villages before getting diluted in this globalized world.

Since China changes very fast, we incessantly update our routes to bring you to untouched places.
