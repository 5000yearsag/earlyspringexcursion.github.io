We require a deposit of 20% of the total price before the travelÂ transferred at least 30 days before your trip.

The remaining amount should be paid before you start your trip.

We accept euros, renminbi and US dollars.

We will confirm the transaction per email.

For calculating the exchange rate, I always use the up to date Universal Currency [Converter website](http://www.xe.com/currencyconverter/).
