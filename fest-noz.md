Fest Noz, Â the breton&#8217;s way of life.

Maybe you&#8217;ve even never heard about a breton, or maybe you have met a French guy who told you, &#8220;I am a breton, from Brittany, you know, nort-west of France.&#8221; We, breton, love our local culture, still so much alive in our region Brittany. Next time you come to France, I will be happy to show you!

&nbsp;

One of the things I miss the most living far away from my homeland Brittany, is definitely dancing in a Fest Noz. It means &#8216;night festival&#8217; in breton language.

Dancing in cercles, in pairs, with children or grandpa&#8217;s

So I decided to organize Fest Noz, here in Dali.
