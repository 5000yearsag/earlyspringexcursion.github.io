_**Dali Express** is based on a quite established technique called “Shadowsocks”, which was created in 2012 by a Chinese programmer named “clowwindy”. It’s the best solution right now, and much, much better than the old fashion “VPN”. As far as I know, this is technically hard to be detected by government up to 2017._
