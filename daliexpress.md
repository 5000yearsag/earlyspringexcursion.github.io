Struggling with Internet in China? Does it also happens to you to have cravings for a fast Youtube connection or a search engine?

Well, finally you have found it here. The train is waiting. Dali Express!



- **We offer top speed in Yunnan**

  *our servers are located in Singapore, it has the best speed except Hong Kong, but  since "Chinese 19th Congress" Yunnan Telecom has blocked a lot of Hong Kong servers.* So the Singapore servers are still our best choice.

- **99.999% Uptime**

  *since "Chinese 19th Congress" we all found it's getting harder to  make our server not disturbed by "them", that's why we also offer a backup server once it goes down which still guarantee 99.999% uptime.* Anyway, for all kind of situations, I try to reply you in 10minutes, if you contact me. 

- **Smart switch**

  *one of the best feature. You don't have to switch on and off all the time, our service determine for you which data should go through vpn. Wow!*

- **face to face support if necessary**

  well... I hope you are not living far from Dali Town.

_**Dali Express** is based on a quite established technique called “Shadowsocks”, which was created in 2012 by a Chinese programmer named “clowwindy”. It’s the best solution right now, and much, much better than the old fashion “V.P.N”. As far as I know, this is technically hard to be detected by government up to 2017. And the only way they can stop this is they come to knock your door. If things go like this, we better leave from China, go back to our home ^__^ !
