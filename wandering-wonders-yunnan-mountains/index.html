  <p>We just came back from a couple of days on a small house on the mountains between Dali and Lijiang. A old couple of farmers is living there with their grand daughter and her parents come to visit once a week. That is how we came here with the parents who are running a chinese medicinal herbs shop in our town. The family is from the Bai minority, the major minority here in Dali.</p>

<h4 id="about-mountain-food">About mountain food</h4>

<h5 id="oil-tea-for-breakfast">Oil tea for breakfast</h5>

<p>After we all woke up, the grandpa started to prepare their traditional breakfast: youcha (oil tea) and baba (bread)‚Ä¶ The oil tea is a drink that keep the body warm and full of energy during the day in the mountains. It is made out of pork fat in which rice is added and fried. Then we add water, salt and tea leaves in the pot and boil it on the fire for about half an hour. The result is a strong, very oily, salty and bit bitter drink. I could even find some pieces of pork fat but I assure you, it tastes delicious with the fresh made baba bread.</p>

<h5 id="pears-apples-and-nuts">Pears, apples and nuts</h5>

<p>We stroll around the mountain and found plenty wild pear and walnut trees. That is also a gift from nature while in our markets and supermarkets, ¬†most of the fruits and vegetables are full of pesticides and other chemicals! We started to fill our backpack with all those different types of pears so it could last us for a while back in Dali.</p>

<h5 id="sichuan-pepper">Sichuan pepper</h5>

<p>The freshly cut bush of Sichuan pepper was filling the air and came to our nose. If you never hear about Sichuan pepper, it is a commonly used spice in Chinese cuisine, it tastes totally strange the first time you eat it and numb your mouth. ¬†During the past years, the more I got to eat it the more I liked it. We had fun taking these small berries from the bush and filled another small bag of it.</p>

<h5 id="honey">Honey</h5>

<p>Honey bees were busy going in and out of their hive located in the clay walls. The taste of the pure honey with the comb and pollen is absolutely delicious. It is particularly rare to find pure honey since most of the bees in China are fed with sugar.</p>

<p>Our hosts‚Äôs first son invited us to have lunch not on the other side of the mountain. The oil tea from breakfast was not finished to digest, we already had lunch. His wife had prepared a chicken for our coming. Wow it is always touching how some people in the countryside treat their guests by offering them the best of what they have‚Ä¶</p>

<h4 id="about-life-on-the-mountain">About life on the mountain</h4>

<p>Life is quite hard up their. The town is about one hour road away, a difficult road full of curves and holes. So the people living here have created a quite autonomous way of life and that is what I think is the most interesting by coming here.</p>

<h5 id="water">Water</h5>

<p>I also was pretty amazed with their water system. They use rainwater from the roof they store in an underground container made of cement. It was the second time in my life I have seen this water system. The first time was in France in the first fully autonomous house called La Maison Autonome in Chateaubriand.</p>

<h5 id="food">Food</h5>

<p>As I have already describe some stuff about food above, I will just add some details. Each family grows vegetables and breeds pigs for their meat and fat (maybe the fat is even more important than meat.) They also have chickens (also here, more for the meat than for their eggs).</p>

<p>The mountain is full of wild plants, nuts and mushrooms. On the way back home, we just bumped into two women who were coming back from their truffle ‚Äúhunting‚Äù and our friend, a real businesss man type, just bought every single one for a pretty good price‚Ä¶</p>

<h5 id="energy">Energy</h5>

<p>I have seen many houses using sun heated water system and solar panels since here in Yunnan, sun is quite an infinite ressource. Otherwise, most of the electricity comes from nearby hydroelectric plants.</p>

<p>Well, I think that‚Äôs for it now</p>

<p>Hope you have learned something üòâ</p>
