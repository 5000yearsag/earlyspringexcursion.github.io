Escape from busy Dali old town for a day on your scooter! Take a deep breath of fresh air and enjoy your freedom!Â Now you can ride and discover at your pace many small historical Bai villages all along the way.

We will have a stop at Xizhou old town, stroll around the morning market, taste a nice sweet rose Baba (a local crispy and savory snack between pancake and bread)&#8230;
