**Dali** is the place we live, we love and we know the best. Sharing Dali life is the best to get to know this place.

Located in the middle of Yunnan, at the intersection of the roads toward Tibet and Myanmar, Dali is now an expanding small town. Dali&#8217; climate, fresh air, landscapes and cultural background attracts many Chinese citizen to move there, escaping the stressed, polluted megalopolis of the east coast for a slower pace of life. The old Town of Dali has now become a mix of Bai minority local culture, urban cities and young artists bohemian lifestyles.
