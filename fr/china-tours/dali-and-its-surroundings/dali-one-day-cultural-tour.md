We all know it&#8217;s so expensive to find a China tour guide, that&#8217;s why we offer you a free tour in Dali. And we wish you will understand more about Chinese culture through us.

Our &#8220;Free Tour of Dali&#8221;, bring you beyond the touristic Dali, to experience the real local Dali lifestyle!

Start : 8.30am    Meeting Point : HongLongJing Gate

#### **Activities:**

So, let&#8217;s start this day journey together! Let&#8217;s walk through small and intimate alleys of Dali towards the market. The market is full of a food you might not know. Dali&#8217;s unique location offers an incredible supply of fresh and wild food sourced from Cangshan mountain and surrounding villages. You can not leave this place without tasting those amazing wild mushrooms or local cheese here!

If you have a bike, we can bring you to visit an ecogarden and can have a look to understand the non alternative China you hardly can hear about.

&nbsp;

Dali people&#8217;s favorite afternoon activity is drinking tea and chat about food, health and ancient chinese culture&#8230; Chinese teas are on one side so well known and on the other side also not fully understood. How do Chinese usually drink tea? That is in many ways very different from you can imagine!

Time schedule : Starting according to your needs, we estimate this day tour takes about two-threee hours.
