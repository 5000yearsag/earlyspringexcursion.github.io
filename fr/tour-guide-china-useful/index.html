  My happiest memories while traveling are definitely meeting local people and sharing a part of their daily life. Living the beauty of diversity. I have been to many different countries around Asia, Europe and Africa, but one of those countries that is not easy to travel is China. Here I want to share you three important reasons why having a good guide can transform your experience in China.

<h3 id="1-a-good-guide-is-also-your-translator-and-beyond-translations-a-communication-facilitator">1-A good guide is also your translator and beyond translations, a communication facilitator</h3>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Communication is the first barrier between the traveler and the local people. While living in China, I bumped into many travelers who do not speak chinese and understand chinese culture. Their journey in China was sometimes a headache from booking train tickets, chatting with a curious neighbor on the bus or ordering a nice food in a restaurant &#8230; Many places to not have English  and just see characters everywhere.
</p>

<h3 id="2-a-good-guide-will-not-take-you-in-those-touristy-areas">2-A good guide will not take you in those touristy areas</h3>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Famous places or those offered in travels agencies are double faced. The fast development of tourism in China completely can change a place into something else within half a year of time. And speaking about tourism, it is often transformed into something not so pleasant.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Bus of tourists along the streets, very loud karaoke style music all over the village, souvenirs shops&#8230; After you have been to a couple of touristic areas in China, you might wish not go to those kind of artificial places again&#8230;
</p>

<h3 id="3--a-good-guide-will-show-you-deep-hidden-places-that-you-wont-find-on-internet">3- A good guide will show you deep hidden places that you won’t find on internet</h3>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Traveling in China can be frustrating not only for foreigner or well-traveled people but even for Chinese who are looking for getting off the beaten tracks. That needs a lot of time and energy to find places not many people talk about!
</p>

<p> </p>

<p>But all of that makes traveling in China so interesting, unique and kind of charming too. China has still so many wonderful aspects to show us. It is just about how you look at it! That’s why we would like to guide travelers through the mysteries of Chinese life.</p>

<p>As you will getting to understand better and better, in China, everything is about having the right key to open you the right door for you.</p>
