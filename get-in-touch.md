### A changing world

&nbsp;

While we have grown up in a so-called modern society, studied from primary school to university, graduated and maybe could get a decent job&#8230; But this would be another story. We all live this kind of life where we need to <span lang="EN-US">get up in the morning, go to work for somebody else&#8217;s interest and ideas and enjoy some crumbs of free time..</span><span lang="EN-US">. We have creativity, ideals and ideas and not much to lose. Inside of us, there was</span><span lang="EN-US"> something else calling us, something we could not describe or know what it was, something we had to go through and discover. </span>

<span lang="EN-US">Therefore both of us spent many years traveling this world. </span>During our travels, two things stroke us the most.

The first is that there, we felt trust,  open hearts and minds, kindness and generosity towards strangers like us, we still were just few minutes ago. Those qualities that makes our human experience so beautiful are becoming rare&#8230;

The second is that o<span lang="EN-US">ur lifestyles are also getting homogenized.</span> T<span lang="EN-US">raditions and basic knowledge are disappearing in an unpredictable pace and are handing over a globalized homogenized world. What happened very gradually in Europe during the last centuries is now happening in a fast and striking way here in China and other countries in this world within a couple of decades.</span>

 <span lang="EN-US">What we mean by disappearing are small life wonders such as </span>

  * <span lang="EN-US">talking to anybody in the bus, </span>
  * <span lang="EN-US">sharing a drink with a stranger in the street, </span>
  * <span lang="EN-US">being dragged in somebody&#8217;s home to have lunch</span>
  * <span lang="EN-US">&#8230; </span>

<span lang="EN-US">and this is replaced by a lot of conveniences so we are numb to this loss. Replaced by home delivery services, big grey buildings, jeans and t-shirt cloths, industrial bread, milk and yogurt everywhere&#8230; Well ok, we also acknowledge we are both profiting a lot of those privileges and conveniences and try to make it each time a conscious choice.</span>

#### A brief introduction

<span lang="EN-US">Our roots are from Germany, France, China and Afghanistan, and life brought us to meet in Dali, China. Now, nestling in our old courtyard near the Ancient City of Dali, we live in a small village in the fields between Cangshan mountains and Erhai lake. When we are not at home, we probably are on the roads somewhere in China, south east Asia or Europe&#8230;</span>

We spent lot of time learning many useful lifetools. Together, we can speak French, Chinese, English, German, Spanish and Japanese. One of the things we enjoy most is jamming with friends around a fire on our violin, guitar and trumpet. We are rich in culture and poor materially.

<span lang="EN-US">We are seeking our unique way to live our life.  This also means facing strong phases of uncertainty, insecurity and learning to live with it. </span>We started to launch this site to be share with the world who we are and what we can bring. That is our way to gather resources to live.
